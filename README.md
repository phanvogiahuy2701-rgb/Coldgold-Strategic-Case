# ColdGold Foods Strategic Growth Case – RUAS Competition

---

## Executive Summary

Analyzed ColdGold Foods’ growth and profitability challenges as part of the PowerPoint Problem-Solving Competition at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. The project evaluated how a focused strategy on high-potential cities, clearer retail/B2B roles, and better use of production capacity could help the company increase market penetration and improve margins.

## Business Problems

ColdGold Foods was struggling with low market penetration, thin profitability, and internal tension between Retail and B2B teams. At the same time, its marketing budget was spread across too many cities and production plants were running far below capacity. The key question was how to concentrate resources and align teams to unlock profitable growth.

## Key Questions

- How can ColdGold increase market penetration in a realistic and cost-effective way?
- Which cities and customer segments should receive priority marketing investment?
- How should Retail and B2B channels be positioned and coordinated to reduce internal conflict?
- What operational and cost measures can improve plant utilization and profitability?

- Mapped how the $16M marketing budget was spread across 18 cities and identified dilution effects.
- Analyzed the roles of Retail and B2B channels and the causes of internal conflict.
- Considered options for focusing on 3–5 high-potential cities and strengthening key retail partners.
- Looked at opportunities to increase plant utilization and reduce costs through leaner operations.
- Structured all findings and recommendations into a clear, competition-ready slide deck.
